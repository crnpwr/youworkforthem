                <div class="step" data-step="rental-crisis-intro"><p>The UK is in the midst of a housing crisis.<br>Rents are going up, which is damaging the UK economy and making life harder for millions of people.</p><p>Scroll down and we'll explore 171 rented properties in detail.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="outline-of-houses"><p>These are properties let out by MPs.</p><p>Most are residential, but some are agricultural or commercial.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="mp-landlords"><p>There are 76 landlords in Parliament, who you can see here.</p><p>Many constituents will struggle when rents go up, while that means more profit to these MPs.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="resize-property-holdings"><p>Some of them have pretty big property empires.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="athwal-highlight"><p>Let's take a look at the biggest landlord in Parliament, Jas Athwal.<br>He's the Labour MP for Ilford South.</p><p>He's collecting rent for eighteen properties, bringing in at least £180,000 per year.<br>Fifteen of these are residential and three are commercial.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="athwal-residential-press"><p>His residential properties have received criticism for their poor condition.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="athwal-commercial-press"><p>His commercial properties have also had issues.</p><p>One is a children's home that is "poorly maintained".<br>Ofsted has been worried about how many children go missing from the home.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-highlight"><p>Let's take another example, Rachel Reeves - Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p><p>She's not as prolific a landlord as others, and she only has one residential let listed.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-expand-74"><p>The register of interests only lets us know that she makes at least £10,000 per year this way.</p><p>But the Telegraph says that her and her husband actually make £74,000 per year from renters.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-household-income"><p>She has a salary of £163,891 and her husband's was over £170,000 in 2024, so between them that's an income of at least £407,891.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-vs-average"><p>This is 11 times the typical family income of £36,700.</p><p>This might make it hard for her to relate to the struggles of ordinary people on issues like benefit cuts.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="ali-highlight"><p>Until recently, Rushanara Ali was homelessness minister for England.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="ali-expand-496"><p>She has two residential lets listed, and we found out from a former tenant that she was making £39,600 from one of them.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="ali-expand-580"><p>She evicted those tenants, saying she was going to sell the house, but then she let it out again for £48,000 per year.</p><p>She was forced to resign as homelessness minister over this, losing £22,375 of her salary.</p><p>Sadly for her, this canceled out the extra money she was able to get from the new tenants.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="anti-renters-rights"><p>23 landlords voted against the Renters' Rights Bill, which was designed to protect renters from unfair evictions.</p><p>They tried to maintain their rights as landlords, as opposed to many of the renters they represent.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="outro"><p>This is just a peek at the landlords of Parliament, based on data collected on 21st August, 2025.</p><p>For a more detailed view that updates regularly, <a href="index.html">click here</a> to see more about the financial records of all 650 MPs.</p></div>
