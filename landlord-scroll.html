                <div class="step" data-step="rental-crisis-intro"><p>The housing crisis and skyrocketing rents are wreaking havoc on the economy of the UK and the wellbeing of its citizens.</p><p>Scroll down and we'll explore 171 rented properties in detail.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="outline-of-houses"><p>These are the residential, commercial and agricultural properties let out by MPs. As we'll show, the data isn't complete but we are able to get a rough picture.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="mp-landlords"><p>There are 76 landlords in Parliament, who you can see here.</p><p>They only have to list the properties they get more than £10,000 per year for, so there are probably more out there.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="resize-property-holdings"><p>Some of them have pretty big property empires.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="athwal-highlight"><p>Let's take a look at the biggest landlord in Parliament, Jas Athwal - the Labour MP for Ilford South.</p><p>He's collecting rent for 15 residential properties and 3 commercial properties, bringing in over £180,000 per year.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="athwal-residential-press"><p>His residential properties have received criticism for their poor condition.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="athwal-commercial-press"><p>He's also been criticised for his commercial lettings.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-highlight"><p>Let's take another example, Rachel Reeves - Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p><p>She's not as prolific a landlord as others, and she only has one residential let listed.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-expand-74"><p>The register of interests only lets us know that she makes £10,000 per year from this.</p><p>Reporting from the Telegraph suggests that her and her husband actually bring in £74,000 per year for their two flats.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-household-income"><p>Taking in to account her £163,891 salary and her husband's reported salary of over £170,000 in 2024, we can see their total household income is at least £407,891.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="reeves-vs-average"><p>This is eleven times the median household income of £36,700, which may make it hard for her to relate to the struggles of ordinary people on issues like benefit cuts.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="ali-highlight"><p>Similarly, we could look at Rushanara Ali - who until recently was homelessness minister for England.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="ali-expand-496"><p>She has two residential lets listed, but we found out from a former tenant that she was making £39,600 from one of them.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="ali-expand-580"><p>She went as far as evicting existing tenants so she could raise this to £48,000 per year - having told them she had plans to sell the house.</p><p>She was forced to resign as homelessness minister over this.</p><p>Sadly for her, this meant losing £22,375 in ministerial salary, more than cancelling out the extra money she was able to extract from the new tenants.</p></div>
                <!--<div class="step" data-step="people-paying-mps"><p>These X MPs have the equivalent of at least Y people working full time just to hand over rent to them. There must be hundreds of people out there working to enrich their own MP, who already is paid a minimum of £X by the taxpayer. Maybe you're one of them.</p></div>-->
                <div class="step" data-step="anti-renters-rights"><p>If this all feels a little academic, it might be worth noting that many of these MPs have actively opposed renters' rights in Parliament by voting against the Renters' Rights Bill.</p><p>As landlords, they resisted moves that could protect renters from unfair evictions and looked to strengthen their own rights, in many cases against the people they're meant to represent.</p></div>
                <div class="step" data-step="outro"><p>This has been a guided walkthrough of the role of landlords in Parliament and their relation to the housing crisis, based on data collected on 21st August, 2025.</p><p>For a more detailed view that updates regularly, you can explore the wider financial records of all MPs in Parliament on the main page.</p></div>
